# 🧠 Mental Health Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict mental health conditions based on lifestyle, demographic, and work-related factors.

## 💼 About the Project

With rising mental health concerns, early prediction can be a game-changer. This ML model is trained on survey data to classify individuals likely experiencing mental health challenges.

## 🔍 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy and ROC AUC evaluation
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes anonymous responses to a mental health survey.

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raj7665/mental-health-prediction-ml.git
cd mental-health-prediction-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook mental_health_prediction.ipynb
```

## 📊 Model Accuracy
Achieved ~85% accuracy using Random Forest Classifier.
